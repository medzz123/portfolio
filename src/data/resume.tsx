  summary: `
I started developing in **2019** after completing my Computer Science degree and have since focused on building and scaling **fintech platforms**.

Iâ€™ve been part of **early engineering teams**, shaping core architecture, designing **Nx/Turbo monorepos**, and improving **developer workflows** to ship fast and reliably.

My work spans **frontend**, **backend**, and **infrastructure** on **GCP**, with experience in CI/CD, automation, and **LLM pipelines** for financial data. I focus on clean architecture, speed, and solving complex problems efficiently.

I was part of the **initial engineering team** that built a **scalable Nx monorepo** using **TypeScript, React, Node.js, and Prisma**, consolidating multiple applications for **merchants, admins, customers, and brokers**.  

I designed the **architecture with code generators** to accelerate development and reduce bugs, implemented **CI/CD pipelines** with **Pulumi and GCP** for seamless deployments, and balanced **speed with maintainability** to drive product solutions.  
      
Additionally, I **architected and implemented company analysis workflows** to support underwriting decisions, integrated **webhook listeners and event-driven processes**, and leveraged **LLMs** to parse **PDFs and extract critical business data**.
