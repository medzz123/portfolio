**Tech Stack** : Java, JavaFx, My SQL

This project which was part of my university course required me to create a software application connected to a database that allowed a hypothetical garage company to manage their day to day necessities. I used Java to create the application, and MySQL to connect to a local database. To design the application I used JavaFx, and used ITextPDF to generate reports and exporting them PDF.

**Main features:** 

Record customer and their vehicles information

Create tasks for mechanics to be complete with each vehicle

Inventory system which allows to automatically order when low in stock

Generate multitude of reports for bookings, inventory, etc.
