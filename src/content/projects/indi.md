**Tech Stack** : VB.NET

This was the first graphical application. The project was built using VB.NET. At the time, I did not know a lot of coding, but this project inspired me to continue coding and learn more.

**Main features:** 

Create user and record details in a database

Select items and apply discounts before sale

Generate receipt in form of pdf


## Will add images soon ...
